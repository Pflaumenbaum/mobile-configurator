This payload is designated by specifying com.apple.security.FDERecoveryRedirect as the PayloadType.\n\t\t\tOnce installed, this payload will cause any FDE (Full Disk Encryption) recovery keys to be redirected to the specified URL instead of being sent to Apple. This will require sites to implement their own HTTPS server that will receive the recovery keys via a POST request.\nNote these cautions:\n• The payload must exist in a system-scoped profile.\n• Installing more than one payload of this type per machine will cause an error.",
